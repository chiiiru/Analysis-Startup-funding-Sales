# Analysis-Startup-funding-Sales


The goal of this project was to analyze startup funding and valuation trends as well as sales data using SQL. The project used four tables: companies, funding, industries, and sales.

For startup funding and valuation trends analysis, the project answered several questions, including which countries and continents have the highest total funding and valuations for startups, what are the top industries that receive the most funding and have the highest valuations, and how funding and valuation change over time for different industries, countries, and continents.

The sales analysis focused on identifying the product lines with the highest sales and revenue, examining sales performance across different client types, and determining the average order size and revenue per order for each warehouse location.

The project utilized SQL queries to extract, transform, and analyze the data, as well as visualizations to present the findings. The project can provide insights into startup funding and valuation trends, as well as sales performance, that can be useful for decision-making and strategic planning.
